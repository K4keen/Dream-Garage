## Dream Garage

<h3>Project Introduction</h3>

<p align="justify">
Every boy must have a <b>Dream Garage</b> in his mind. The <b>Dream Garage</b> will allow collector to easily manage their car collection by adding and removing cars. However, the cooler thing is that you can use the smart generator to generate a garage which is filtered by the range of year or price, this will make you find your target cars faster. Moreover, the garage will be automatically saved in your collection as a record, so that you can find it easily whenever you want. Also, it's free to remove the garages combination if you no longer need it.

The application are for all car lovers, who are owning lots of cars or will own lots of cars. It's a easy using management tool as well as a tool for recording the dream cars.

Personally, this project interests me because I am a *car lover* dreaming of being an amateur racer, and the project will bring me a step closer to my dream.
